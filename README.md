# TensorFlowGettingStarted
Here is an accompanying dialogue portion of my <a href=https://medium.com/@TimWroge/getting-started-with-tensorflow-introduction-to-neural-networks-7ba9eeefc47f>Getting Started with TensorFlow blog on Medium </a> as well as my <a href=https://medium.com/@TimWroge/getting-started-with-tensorflow-basics-of-the-tensorflow-api-1cc2dbdb5db8>Intro to the TensorFlow API</a>


This code should be a good stepping stone to legitimate coding with TensorFlow to construct advanced neural network architechtures on a low level, in order to understand the higher level API, when we get to that point.
